# Parcelman
A simple parcel management system.
First of all, you must have `bower` installed on your computer. To do this:
- Install nodejs at [their official website](http://nodejs.org).
- Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Make sure you choose "Integrate into Command Prompt" kinda option.
- Open up your Command Prompt and type `npm install bower`
- Still in the Command Prompt, assuming you are on XAMPP, type `cd C:\xampp\htdocs` and press Enter.
- Then type `git clone http://github.com/r0lodex/parcelman parcelman` and Enter.
- Once it is done, type `cd client`
- Then `bower install`
- If everything is OK and your Apache & MySQL is running fine, head on to `http://localhost/parcelman/client` and you're done.
